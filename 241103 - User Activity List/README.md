# User Activity List
The goal of this project is to create an AL extension for Business Central that will create a log of pages that a user visits.

While there is a limitation to this coding method, the basic concept is acheivable. I was hoping that I could find a way to process page interaction logs more "programactically", I was not able to acheive this goal in the timeline I give myself for these "Coffee Challenge" practices. Maybe one day I can return and visit this challenge again with a more dynamic solution. However, at this time, I hope this proof of conceept helps inspire and guide you to your own possible soltion for challenges such as this.

## Notes
